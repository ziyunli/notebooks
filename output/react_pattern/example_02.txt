PAUSE
 -- running simon_blog_search Madagascar
Observation: Weeknotes: More releases, more museums: Lots of small releases this week.
Datasette
I released two bug fix releases for Datasette - 0.30.1 and 0.30.2. Changelog here. My Dogsheep personal analytics project means I&#39;m using Datasette for my own data analysis every day, which inspires me to fix small but annoying bugs much more aggressively.
I&#39;ve also set myself a Streak goal to land a commit to Datasette every day.
I landed a tiny new feature to master yesterday: a ?column__notin=x,y,z filter, working as an inverse of the existing ?column__in=x,y,z filter. See issue #614 for details.
More Niche Museums
I&#39;ve been keeping up my streak of adding at least one new museum to www.niche-museums.com every day. This week I added the Pirates Museum in Antananarivo, Madagascar, the David Rumsey Map Center at Stanford, Galerie de Paléontologie et d’Anatomie comparée in Paris, DEVIL-ish Little Things in Vancouver, Washington, Mardi Gras World in New Orleans, Environmental Volunteers EcoCenter in Palo Alto, the Evergreen A
